Hello there!

I would like to introduce to you all ЯR Bots! After a year or so in continuous development, I am happy to release to you all a TF2 Trade Bot. I have privately used this bot for a year and fixed many issues whilst adding many features which I think may be useful to the owner of the bots.

Features of ЯR Bot:

- Ability to post listings on Backpack.tf (both buy and sell)

- FREE Automatic Price updates! - Yes! This is free, unlike other bot services which require payment for auto pricing. If you want you can continuously request the bot to reprice its items!

- Custom Owner Controls.

- Send invitations to users to join a unique group.

- Extensive Monitoring Tools - through the use of Discord live trade photos are sent, whilst through Steam, the owner gets detailed trade receipts including the information about the other user who just traded your bot.

- SteamRep Scammer check

- Display statistics of your bot, regarding trades, accepted and declined.  

- And so much more!

How to get ЯR Bot:

You will have to contact me! Information below.

This bot will be available to anyone and will be distributed in a similar fashion to how Bot.tf works, but a bit different. The only difference is, you provide the steam account you wish to be your trade bot. After that, you will be in the driving seat!

Your ЯR Bot will be hosted on a VPS provided by me (just like Bot.tf). Meaning it will be running 24/7! More trades done!! 

Pricing:

Will be a subscription based. Contact me for further information. I can assure you that it will be the best pricing currently offered.
